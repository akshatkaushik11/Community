# Community
We created a portal for NYU students, which pulls out events happening around the city from various sources including the option of creating events. Users can view occasions related to their preferences and RSVP to specific events. Additionally, their is also a discuss functionality which enables group chats on specific themes to help students manifest their ideas together.
